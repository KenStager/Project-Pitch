#### Comments for the Group:
- **Error Handling**: All major functions include try-except blocks for robust error handling. Errors are logged and managed through a centralized `handle_error` function.
- **Logging**: The logging system is initialized at the start, which will help in tracking the flow and identifying issues during execution.
- **Data Caching**: Functions for caching data (`cache_data`) and retrieving cached data (`retrieve_cached_data`) are included. This ensures efficiency, especially when dealing with large datasets or repeated operations.
- **Modular Design**: The code is broken down into smaller, reusable modules like `make_api_request` and `parse_data`, enhancing code reusability and readability.
- **Data Parsing and Processing**: Separate functions for parsing and processing data allow for more flexible and maintainable code.

This finalized pseudocode should provide a comprehensive, robust, and modular framework for the project, addressing the core functionalities while ensuring error handling, logging, and efficient data management.

  - Retrieves historical stock data within the specified date range.
  - Caches this data for efficiency in subsequent runs.
  - Identifies volatile periods within the stock data for focused analysis.

- **Historical News Data Analysis**:
  - Fetches and caches historical news data corresponding to the identified volatile periods.
  - Performs sentiment analysis on this historical news data.

- **Real-Time News Data Analysis**:
  - Scrapes the latest news data at defined time intervals.
  - Analyzes the sentiment of this real-time news data.

- **Predictive Modeling**:
  - Builds a predictive model based on the historical sentiment and stock data.
  - Uses the model to predict market movement based on real-time sentiment data.

- **Logging and Error Handling**: 
  - Throughout the script, various logging statements track the progress and capture any issues.
  - The script includes checks and error logs if any of the main steps fail.

- **Output**: 
  - The final predictions are printed out. These could also be stored or used in further analysis or reporting.

This expanded main execution section of the pseudocode provides a detailed, step-by-step guide on how the project's script will run, emphasizing robust error handling, efficient data processing, and logging for transparency and debugging purposes.
